        The Sumela Monastery is one of the oldest and most historic monasteries in the Christian world.   
        There are no exact records about when it was built or by who, 
        but it is estimated that its history dates back some one thousand years and that the 
        locals who constructed it did so to escape enemy attacks.  
        Located high up on the steep cliffs above the surrounding forest in Trabzon, Turkey, 
        this incredible feat of architecture has changed hands many times over the course of its existence, 
        until it was finally abandoned in 1923.

        Hagia Sophia in Trabzon, Turkey was built between 1238 and 1263 during the reign of Manual Comnenos I. 
    After Sultan Mehmet the Conqueror took Trabzon in 1461, the church was converted to a mosque 
    and its frescoes were white-washed.
     The mosque was in a state of ruin for a time, then restored in 1864. 
    During WWI it was occupied by the Russian military and used as a hospital and depot, then returned to use as a mosque. 
    From 1958 to 1964 the frescoes were uncovered with the help of experts from Edinburgh University and in 1964 
    Hagia Sophia was opened as a museum. Only about one-sixth of the original decorations survive. 
    It is an example of late Byzantine architecture with a high central dome supported by four column arches. 
    The church is a cross in a square plan, but with north and south porches, 
    the outside takes the shape of a cross. West of the church is a bell tower built in 1427.

        It was built in Soğuksu, one of the recreation spots of Trabzon in 1890 by Konstantin Kabayannidis- a banker from Trabzon as a summer house. 
    The pavilion was given to the treasure in İ923. On 15th September, 1924 Atatürk visited and liked the pavilion on his first visit to Trabzon. 
    In line with Constant Province Council’s decision in chapter 361, dated 18.05.1931, the pavilion was given to Atatürk as a gift by the people of Trabzon.
Contrary to the documented sources till now, Atatürk stayed here only on his last visit to Trabzon from 10th to 12th June, 1937, 
    also made a decision which is very important for our history, and gave his property to the treasure and sent it to Prime Minister İnönü by a telegram. 
    It was bought from his sister -Makbule Hamm after his death on 6th April, 1943 by Trabzon Municipality, was decorated and opened it as Atatürk Museum.
The building has some traces from European Architecture and has four floors.
Side features and the decoration of the building have the features of European Architect.
     In the entrance floor, there is Atatürk’s living room, dining room and guest room.
     On the first floor, are Atatürk’s bedroom, the rooms for his assistant and guard. 
    On the second floor where we go through the wooden stairs, there are two big rooms which are opened to a big room.
